    > LogViewer : Search where all lines that match are placed into sub-pane.
    > SimpleParser : Editing a parsing rule doesnt update the UI.
    > CaseNotes : Shift-Tab does not undo Indents.
    > CaseNotes : MulitTab lines indent differently than single indents in the "allnotes_X" file.

    - Workspaces : Exit button within the Tab to close window.
    - Workspaces : Redesign UX/UI for Showing or Hiding the various Workspace Panes.

    [Ideas]
    - Files with notes should have some kind of UI notifications
    - JIRA status check based on bug state using Jira API.
    - JIRA preformatted search, leverage product for case if defined.
