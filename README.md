Project Philosophy : a Haiku
> Bring Zen to *YOUR* work  
> Repeitition prevents flow     
> Simplify the task  

**Basecamp is a GUI and/or CLI tool with the goal to automate the repeatable and often tedious tasks for TSE's supporting McAfee Enterprise Products.** The *Engine* behind **Basecamp** has been designed to fundamentally promote the *Project Philosophy* and allow the project to scale to the limits of Engineer's imaginations and needs. With the modular framework of the *Engine*, users are able to "expand" the functionality of **Basecamp** to adapt to THEIR workflow by writing their own **Automations**. Allowing **Basecamp** to serve any Engineer's needs, while providing an elegant, powerful, and feature-rich base. Finally, It is important that **Basecamp** remains Open-source and true to the *Project Philosophy* - I personally feel this will keep this project aligned to the original intent, "Bringing Zen to the *TSE* workflow."
